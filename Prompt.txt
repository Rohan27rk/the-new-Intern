What is guid
Copilot said:
Copilot
In C#, a Guid (short for Globally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit value used to uniquely identify information. It's commonly used for identifiers in databases, APIs, and systems where uniqueness is critical.

Key Points about Guid:
It ensures uniqueness across space and time.
It's represented as a 32-character hexadecimal string, like:
3f2504e0-4f89-11d3-9a0c-0305e82c3301
In your Notification class, both Id and UserId are of type Guid, meaning:
Id uniquely identifies each notification.
UserId links the notification to a specific user.
Example Usage:
To generate a new Guid in C#:




C#
Guid newId = Guid.NewGuid();

Would you like help integrating this model with a database or using it in a service?

Intern Progress Tracker

#Admin

- Admin should perform CRUD operation for Interns, Managers and Trainers, Admin

#Manager

-Manager can view and monitor the progress of interns under specific trainer
-Manager can view and track the progress of assessment and quizzed submitted by the interns in the form of data visualization(pie, bar graph)

#Trainer

-Trainer creates the task with title, description, deadline
-Trainers provides quiz questions, correct answers and severity in(Excel, XML, CSV) format 
-The given format is converted into a structured JSON format for rendering 
-Response submitted by interns are stored and made visible to both trainer and manager
-Trainer can assign tasks and quizzes to interns under him/her
-Trainer sets the deadline for specific tasks and quiz
-When interns submit the task in the given deadline then trainer will see the GitHub repo of individual intern and gives the score 
-Trainer should see the progress of individual intern based on task and quiz marks along with leaderboard of interns
-Progress should be in data visualization

#Interns

-Interns can view the task & quiz assigned by their respective trainers
-Once the trainers posts the tasks or quiz the intern should get notification with the deadline as an in-app-alert
-Intern should perform the given task and submit GitHub repo link which should be seen by the trainer in their dashboard
-intern should see the leaderboard and should see their quiz score too

üìà Key Features
Role-based dashboards.
Data visualization for performance tracking.
File parsing (Excel/XML/CSV ‚Üí JSON).
Notifications system.
Leaderboard for competitive motivation.
GitHub integration for task submissions.
üß± Suggested Tech Stack
Frontend: Angular / React
Backend: ASP.NET Core / Node.js
Database: SQL Server / PostgreSQL
File Parsing: C# libraries (e.g., EPPlus for Excel, XmlSerializer, CsvHelper)
Visualization: Chart.js / D3.js
Authentication: JWT / IdentityServer
Notifications: SignalR (for real-time alerts)
Would you like help designing the database schema, API endpoints, or UI wireframes for this project?

Dont use Guid and Use Validations as well

Perfect! Since you're using the Code First approach with Entity Framework Core, and you want to avoid Guid and include validations, here's how you can define your models using int as primary keys and Data Annotations for validation.
